<h2> 11/6/25</h2>
<h3> I've done things but haven't recorded them in the journal. I will start to record everything from now on. I'm gonna work on animating the home page, and start to make a game.</h3>

<h3> We learned about functions. We can make our own functions. I made a function that makes a dancing dog move when keys are pressed</h3>
<h2> 11/24/25</h2>
<h3> I made a project that pops corn kernels</h3>
<h2> 12/1/25</h2>
